A lightweight local bot that runs a speed test on your network every 30 minutes, scans active devices on your LAN using `nmap`, and logs everything to a local SQLite database.

Every 4 hours, it delivers a **detailed report** complete with a 24-hour trend graph and a sarcastic, LLM-generated commentary on your network's behavior (*"someone's hogging the bandwidth again"*).

> [!NOTE]
> **100% Private & Self-Hosted:** No external metric servers involved — everything runs locally on your machine or Raspberry Pi. Only text reports and graph images are dispatched to your chosen notifier (Telegram or Discord).

---

## Features & Workflow

Every `SLEEP_TIME` seconds (default 1800 = 30 min, configurable):

1. **Speed Test:** Measures download/upload speeds, ping latency, ISP, and test server details using `speedtest-cli` (see [the note on measurement mode](#a-note-on-measurement-mode)).
2. **LAN Scan:** Scans the local subnet using `nmap` ARP scan to identify active devices, including MAC address, vendor, and hostname where resolvable (see [Device Watch](#device-watch)).
3. **Local Storage:** Saves metrics & device details directly to a local `metrics.sql` SQLite database, automatically pruning rows older than `RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90 days) so the file doesn't grow forever.
4. **Status Alert:** Sends a concise status update to your chosen notifier (*"all good"* or *"line is dying"*).
5. **24h AI Report:** Every `REPORT_CYCLE_COUNT` cycles (default 8, i.e. ~4h), generates a **24-hour trend graph** via `matplotlib` alongside a sarcastic LLM analysis of network load, speed fluctuations, and any notable new devices on the network.
6. **Instant Outage Alerting:** Watches every cycle for an outright failed speed test or a degraded reading, alerting immediately rather than waiting for the next scheduled report (see [Instant Outage & Degradation Alerting](#instant-outage--degradation-alerting)).

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3.13+** (via `uv`) | Core runtime |
| **SQLite** | Local metrics persistence (`metrics.sql`) |
| **`speedtest-cli`** | Network bandwidth and ping measurements |
| **`nmap`** | Subnet ARP scanning for device discovery |
| **`matplotlib`** | 24-hour metrics visualization |
| **OpenAI-compatible API** | Sarcastic report & trend analysis (cloud OpenAI or a local LLM) |
| **Telegram API / Discord Webhooks** | Alert and graph report delivery |

---

## Requirements

* **OS:** macOS or Linux (`nmap --iflist` required; Windows not supported out of the box).
* **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — manages the Python version, virtualenv, and locked dependencies for you. No manual `python3`/`venv`/`pip` juggling.
* **System Binaries:** `nmap` and `speedtest-cli` installed system-wide.
* **Passwordless `sudo` for `nmap`** — device counting needs a real ARP scan (raw sockets), which requires root; see one-time setup below.
* **Tokens:** either a Telegram Bot Token + Chat ID, *or* a Discord Webhook URL (see [Notifications](#notifications-telegram-or-discord)), plus an API key for your OpenAI-compatible provider (not needed if you point `AI_BASE_URL` at a local LLM server).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. System Dependencies

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install nmap speedtest-cli
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nmap speedtest-cli
```

### 2. Allow Passwordless `nmap` (one-time)

Device counting runs `nmap` as root for a real ARP scan — without it, host discovery silently falls back to ordinary TCP probing and undercounts devices that don't answer on common ports. Since the bot runs unattended, `sudo` needs to work without a password prompt on every cycle:

```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: $(command -v nmap)" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/netmon-nmap
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/netmon-nmap
```

This grants passwordless `sudo` only for the `nmap` binary — not your whole account.

### 3. Clone & Setup Environment

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you don't have it yet:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Role1776/netmon.git
cd netmon
uv sync
```

`uv sync` downloads the pinned Python version (see `.python-version`) if you don't already have it, creates `.venv`, and installs the exact locked dependency versions from `uv.lock`. No system `python3`, no manual venv activation.

### 4. Configure `.env`

Copy the template file and fill in your secrets:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` variables:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AI_API_KEY` | Your LLM provider API key (any string works for most local servers) |
| `AI_MODEL` | Model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`, or a local model name — see below) |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | Base API URL (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`, or your local server's URL) |
| `NOTIFIER` | `telegram` (default) or `discord` — picks which service receives alerts |
| `TG_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token from `@BotFather` — required if `NOTIFIER=telegram` |
| `TG_CHAT_ID` | Your Telegram Chat ID — required if `NOTIFIER=telegram` |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord channel webhook URL — required if `NOTIFIER=discord` |
| `DB_PATH` | SQLite database file path (e.g. `metrics.sql`) |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | *Optional.* HTTP timeout in seconds for Telegram/Discord requests (positive integer, default `30`) |
| `SLEEP_TIME` | *Optional.* Seconds between each speed test + device scan cycle (positive integer, default `1800`) |
| `REPORT_CYCLE_COUNT` | *Optional.* How many cycles between detailed AI reports with graph (positive integer, default `8`) |
| `AI_CONTEXT_SIZE` | *Optional.* Sets Ollama's `num_ctx` per-request, to stop a local model's default context window from silently truncating a long prompt + a day of history. No effect on cloud OpenAI — leave unset unless self-hosting the AI backend. |
| `RETENTION_DAYS` | *Optional.* How many days of metrics/device-scan history to keep before old rows are pruned automatically (positive integer, default `90`) |

> [!TIP]
> **You're not locked into OpenAI.** `ai.py` talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so a local inference server (e.g. [Ollama](https://ollama.com), LM Studio) works too — just point `AI_BASE_URL` at it. For report quality that holds up, use a model with **at least ~7B parameters**; a solid local pick is **Gemma 4 12B at 4-bit (QAT) quantization** (`gemma4:12b-it-qat` via Ollama), which fits comfortably on 16GB of RAM.

### 5. Run the Bot

```bash
uv run main.py
```

`uv run` always uses this project's own `.venv` and pinned Python version, so it can't accidentally run against your system `python3`.

> [!TIP]
> Run the bot inside `tmux`/`screen` or set it up as a system service (`systemd`/`launchd`) to keep it running 24/7 in the background.

> [!TIP]
> Pass `--test-ai` (`uv run main.py --test-ai`) to force the very first cycle to run the full detailed report (AI commentary + graph + notifier delivery) immediately, then resume the normal `REPORT_CYCLE_COUNT` schedule automatically — no config to remember to revert afterward. Useful for verifying your AI backend and notifier work without waiting for the regular cadence.

---

## Notifications: Telegram or Discord

netmon supports two notification backends, selected via the `NOTIFIER` variable in `.env`. Only one is needed.

### Telegram (default)

1. Message [`@BotFather`](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram and send `/newbot`, following the prompts to get a **bot token**.
2. Get your **Chat ID** — the simplest way is to message your new bot, then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser and read the `chat.id` field from the JSON response.
3. In `.env`:
   ```
   NOTIFIER=telegram
   TG_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:AAHfoo...
   TG_CHAT_ID=987654321
   ```

If `NOTIFIER` is left unset, netmon defaults to Telegram, so existing setups keep working with no changes.

### Discord

1. In your target Discord channel: **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**, then copy the webhook URL. No bot invite or permissions setup needed.
2. In `.env`:
   ```
   NOTIFIER=discord
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxx/yyyy
   ```

Discord delivery reuses the same report content as Telegram — the existing HTML formatting (`<b>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`) is automatically converted to Discord markdown, so reports render correctly in either service without any changes to the AI prompt.

Reports are sent as an embed on Discord (4096-character limit) rather than plain message content (which Discord hard-caps at 2000), and Telegram messages/captions are safety-net truncated at their own platform limits (4096/1024 chars) — so a longer-than-expected AI report gets a visible `…` truncation instead of being silently cut off mid-sentence.

> [!WARNING]
> Treat both the Telegram bot token and the Discord webhook URL as secrets — anyone with either can post messages through your bot/webhook. Don't commit them to version control (`.env` is already git-ignored).

---

## A Note on Measurement Mode

netmon runs `speedtest --secure --single --json` (see `runner.py`) — the `--single` flag means the test uses **one TCP connection**. This is deliberate: a single stream approximates what one real application on your network would actually get, since it is subject to the same window-size and packet-loss limits any ordinary download faces.

Multi-threaded speed tests (including Ookla's official CLI, and the speedtest.net web UI) open many parallel connections instead. That measures something different — the practical ceiling of your line — and will report noticeably higher numbers on fast connections. Neither figure is "wrong"; they answer different questions.

Two consequences worth knowing:

* **Don't compare netmon's numbers directly against speedtest.net in a browser.** The browser test is multi-threaded and will read higher. That gap is methodology, not a fault in your line.
* **On very fast links (roughly 500 Mbps+), expect single-stream figures to sit well below your subscribed speed.** Beyond the methodology gap, `speedtest-cli` is pure Python, so at gigabit speeds its own CPU overhead starts contributing too — see [Installing Ookla's CLI](#installing-ooklas-cli) below if this matters for your connection.

Since netmon exists to track *trends*, consistency matters more than peak numbers: keep one measurement method for the lifetime of your database. Swapping the backend mid-history puts a step change in your 24-hour graph that the AI commentary will faithfully report as a real speed jump.

### Installing Ookla's CLI

If your reported speeds look suspiciously low compared to your known line speed (per the 500 Mbps+ note above), switch to **Ookla's official CLI** instead of `speedtest-cli`:

```bash
sudo bash install-ookla-speedtest.sh
```

This pulls Ookla's static binary tarball directly (matched to your CPU architecture: x86_64, aarch64, armhf, or i386) rather than adding Ookla's apt repository. That avoids a real failure mode on less mainstream distros/architectures (e.g. Armbian, Orange Pi) where the apt repo doesn't carry a build for the exact distro/arch combination — an apt-based install can fail partway through, after the repo keyring is already added, leaving the system half-configured. This script makes no system changes at all if the download fails.

No application code changes are required — netmon keeps calling `speedtest --secure --single --json` exactly as before, now served by a wrapper around Ookla's engine that also reports jitter and packet loss (see [Jitter & Bufferbloat](#jitter--bufferbloat-ookla-backend-only) below).

### Jitter & Bufferbloat (Ookla backend only)

Classic `speedtest-cli` has no jitter or packet-loss data. If you instead run netmon against an Ookla-compatible speed test backend that reports those fields, netmon picks them up automatically and surfaces them in both mini and detailed reports, alongside a note from the AI treating high jitter or nonzero packet loss as a sign of bufferbloat — a connection can have great raw Mbps numbers and still feel laggy under load if jitter is high. This is entirely additive: nothing changes in reports if your backend doesn't provide this data.

---

## Device Watch

Every device scan records each device's MAC address, vendor (resolved from `nmap`'s built-in OUI database), and hostname where available. `nmap` can only resolve a MAC for hosts on the same local subnet it can ARP directly — off-subnet or otherwise hidden devices are still counted, just not identified. A device with no resolvable MAC is never flagged by either check below, since there's no reliable identity to compare against.

**New devices:** the detailed AI report includes a **Device Watch** section that flags any device whose MAC hasn't been seen on the network in the last 14 days, alongside a vendor-count breakdown of everything currently online.

**Missing devices:** the reverse case — netmon flags a device as "reliably known" once it's been seen in at least `DEVICE_MISSING_RELIABILITY` of scans over the last `DEVICE_MISSING_LOOKBACK_DAYS`. If a reliably-known device then vanishes for `DEVICE_MISSING_CONSECUTIVE_READINGS` consecutive checks, netmon sends an instant alert, and another once it reappears with how long it was gone.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DEVICE_MISSING_LOOKBACK_DAYS` | *Optional.* How far back to look when judging whether a device is reliably known (positive integer, default `3`) |
| `DEVICE_MISSING_RELIABILITY` | *Optional.* Fraction of scans in the lookback window a device must appear in to count as reliably known (0 exclusive–1 inclusive, default `0.8`) |
| `DEVICE_MISSING_CONSECUTIVE_READINGS` | *Optional.* Consecutive missing checks before alerting (positive integer, default `2`) |

---

## Connectivity Heartbeat

Full speed test cycles can be 30+ minutes apart, so a short outage could start and fully resolve without ever being noticed. Between cycles, netmon runs a lightweight TCP connect (not ICMP — avoids needing root) to `HEARTBEAT_HOST:HEARTBEAT_PORT` every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, and alerts once after `HEARTBEAT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` failed checks in a row, then again on recovery.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `HEARTBEAT_HOST` | *Optional.* Host to check reachability against (default `1.1.1.1`) |
| `HEARTBEAT_PORT` | *Optional.* Port to connect to (1–65535, default `443`) |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | *Optional.* Seconds between heartbeat checks while waiting for the next full cycle (positive integer, default `60`) |
| `HEARTBEAT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` | *Optional.* Consecutive failed checks before alerting (positive integer, default `3`) |

### 4-Hour Detailed Report (With Graph & AI Analysis)

Every 4 hours, the bot sends a **24-hour matplotlib graph** accompanied by a sarcastic LLM-generated report:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/example_graph.png" alt="24h Network Speed Test Graph" width="650" />
</p>

```html
<b>Network Speed Test Report (24h Analysis)</b>

Client: <b>MyISP</b>
Server: <b>New York</b>

<b>Latest Test Metrics</b>
<pre>
Download: 178.5 Mbps
Upload: 45.2 Mbps
Ping: 23.1 ms
Jitter: 4.2 ms | Packet Loss: 0.0%
Devices Online: 9
</pre>

<b>24-Hour Dynamics Analysis</b>
Over the last 24 hours, the download speed averaged <code>140 Mbps</code>, but we saw a massive drop to <code>20 Mbps</code> at 8:00 PM right as device count jumped from <code>4</code> to <code>11 devices</code>. Clearly, someone's hogging the bandwidth or the ISP's mice were busy chewing on the fiber line again. Latency remained stable except for a brief spike during peak hours.

<b>Device Watch</b>
One new gadget joined the party today: a device with no vendor or hostname info at all — worth a second glance. Everything else is the same suspects as always.

<b>Data Transfer (Latest Test)</b>
<pre>
Downloaded: 160.0 MB
Uploaded: 70.0 MB
</pre>

<b>Conclusion</b>
Expect periodic speed drops whenever local freeloaders stream 4K movies or the ISP potato infrastructure struggles.
```

> [!NOTE]
> The AI is only ever asked for three short text fields (the dynamics analysis, the Device Watch line, and the conclusion) — the surrounding HTML structure above is assembled deterministically in code, not generated by the model. This keeps report formatting consistent regardless of which LLM is behind `AI_BASE_URL`, including smaller local models that would otherwise struggle to reproduce a long literal template reliably. The `Jitter` line only appears when your speed test backend reports it (see [Jitter & Bufferbloat](#jitter--bufferbloat-ookla-backend-only)) — it's silently omitted otherwise.

---

## Instant Outage & Degradation Alerting

Waiting for the next scheduled detailed report to notice an outage could mean a multi-hour delay. netmon instead watches every cycle:

* **Outage:** the speed test itself fails outright for `OUTAGE_CONSECUTIVE_READINGS` consecutive cycles.
* **Degradation:** a successful reading falls below `OUTAGE_DOWNLOAD_THRESHOLD_MBPS` or above `OUTAGE_PING_THRESHOLD_MS` for the same number of consecutive cycles.

Each fires an alert once per episode (not every cycle, to avoid spam), and again once the connection recovers, with how long the episode lasted.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `OUTAGE_DOWNLOAD_THRESHOLD_MBPS` | *Optional.* Download speed below which a reading counts as degraded (positive number, default `20`) |
| `OUTAGE_PING_THRESHOLD_MS` | *Optional.* Ping above which a reading counts as degraded (positive number, default `150`) |
| `OUTAGE_CONSECUTIVE_READINGS` | *Optional.* Consecutive bad/failed readings before alerting (positive integer, default `2`) |

> [!NOTE]
> A failing or degraded speed test is treated as the exact condition this tool exists to detect, not a bug in netmon — it alerts and keeps retrying every cycle rather than crashing the process (see [Reliability](#reliability) below for the genuine-infra-failure case, which is handled differently on purpose).

---

## Reliability

Speed test, device scan, database, or notifier-delivery failures are **never silently retried**. If one of these fails, netmon makes a best-effort attempt to post an alert to your configured notifier — so the failure is visible without checking server logs — then crashes rather than looping on a broken state. Check the service logs (`journalctl -u netmon` if running under `systemd`, or wherever your process manager sends output) for the full traceback, and your process manager's restart policy will bring it back up.

This is deliberately different from how a *slow or unreachable AI backend* is handled: that degrades gracefully (the report still sends, just without AI commentary) rather than crashing, since a flaky LLM endpoint isn't the kind of infrastructure failure worth stopping the whole monitor over.
