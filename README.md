A lightweight local bot that runs a speed test on your network every 30 minutes, scans active devices on your LAN using `nmap`, and logs everything to a local SQLite database.

Every 4 hours, it delivers a **detailed report** complete with a 24-hour trend graph and a sarcastic, LLM-generated commentary on your network's behavior (*"someone's hogging the bandwidth again"*).

> [!NOTE]
> **100% Private & Self-Hosted:** No external metric servers involved — everything runs locally on your machine or Raspberry Pi. Only text reports and graph images are dispatched to your chosen notifier (Telegram or Discord).

---

## Features & Workflow

Every 30 minutes (`SLEEP_TIME` in `main.py`, default 1800 seconds):

1. **Speed Test:** Measures download/upload speeds, ping latency, ISP, and test server details using `speedtest-cli` (see [the note on measurement mode](#a-note-on-measurement-mode)).
2. **LAN Scan:** Scans the local subnet using `nmap` ARP scan to count active connected devices.
3. **Local Storage:** Saves metrics & device tallies directly to a local `metrics.sql` SQLite database.
4. **Status Alert:** Sends a concise status update to your chosen notifier (*"all good"* or *"line is dying"*).
5. **24h AI Report:** Every 8th cycle (every 4h), generates a **24-hour trend graph** via `matplotlib` alongside a sarcastic LLM analysis of network load and speed fluctuations.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3.13+** (via `uv`) | Core runtime |
| **SQLite** | Local metrics persistence (`metrics.sql`) |
| **`speedtest-cli`** | Network bandwidth and ping measurements |
| **`nmap`** | Subnet ARP scanning for device discovery |
| **`matplotlib`** | 24-hour metrics visualization |
| **OpenAI-compatible API** | Sarcastic report & trend analysis (cloud OpenAI or a local LLM) |
| **Telegram API / Discord Webhooks** | Alert and graph report delivery |

---

## Requirements

* **OS:** macOS or Linux (`nmap --iflist` required; Windows not supported out of the box).
* **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — manages the Python version, virtualenv, and locked dependencies for you. No manual `python3`/`venv`/`pip` juggling.
* **System Binaries:** `nmap` and `speedtest-cli` installed system-wide.
* **Passwordless `sudo` for `nmap`** — device counting needs a real ARP scan (raw sockets), which requires root; see one-time setup below.
* **Tokens:** either a Telegram Bot Token + Chat ID, *or* a Discord Webhook URL (see [Notifications](#notifications-telegram-or-discord)), plus an API key for your OpenAI-compatible provider (not needed if you point `AI_BASE_URL` at a local LLM server).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. System Dependencies

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install nmap speedtest-cli
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nmap speedtest-cli
```

### 2. Allow Passwordless `nmap` (one-time)

Device counting runs `nmap` as root for a real ARP scan — without it, host discovery silently falls back to ordinary TCP probing and undercounts devices that don't answer on common ports. Since the bot runs unattended, `sudo` needs to work without a password prompt on every cycle:

```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: $(command -v nmap)" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/netmon-nmap
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/netmon-nmap
```

This grants passwordless `sudo` only for the `nmap` binary — not your whole account.

### 3. Clone & Setup Environment

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you don't have it yet:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Role1776/netmon.git
cd netmon
uv sync
```

`uv sync` downloads the pinned Python version (see `.python-version`) if you don't already have it, creates `.venv`, and installs the exact locked dependency versions from `uv.lock`. No system `python3`, no manual venv activation.

### 4. Configure `.env`

Copy the template file and fill in your secrets:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` variables:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AI_API_KEY` | Your LLM provider API key (any string works for most local servers) |
| `AI_MODEL` | Model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`, or a local model name — see below) |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | Base API URL (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`, or your local server's URL) |
| `NOTIFIER` | `telegram` (default) or `discord` — picks which service receives alerts |
| `TG_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token from `@BotFather` — required if `NOTIFIER=telegram` |
| `TG_CHAT_ID` | Your Telegram Chat ID — required if `NOTIFIER=telegram` |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord channel webhook URL — required if `NOTIFIER=discord` |
| `DB_PATH` | SQLite database file path (e.g. `metrics.sql`) |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | *Optional.* HTTP timeout in seconds for Telegram/Discord requests (positive integer, default `30`) |

> [!TIP]
> **You're not locked into OpenAI.** `ai.py` talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so a local inference server (e.g. [Ollama](https://ollama.com), LM Studio) works too — just point `AI_BASE_URL` at it. For report quality that holds up, use a model with **at least ~7B parameters**; a solid local pick is **Gemma 4 12B at 4-bit (QAT) quantization** (`gemma4:12b-it-qat` via Ollama), which fits comfortably on 16GB of RAM.

### 5. Run the Bot

```bash
uv run main.py
```

`uv run` always uses this project's own `.venv` and pinned Python version, so it can't accidentally run against your system `python3`.

> [!TIP]
> Run the bot inside `tmux`/`screen` or set it up as a system service (`systemd`/`launchd`) to keep it running 24/7 in the background.

---

## Notifications: Telegram or Discord

netmon supports two notification backends, selected via the `NOTIFIER` variable in `.env`. Only one is needed.

### Telegram (default)

1. Message [`@BotFather`](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram and send `/newbot`, following the prompts to get a **bot token**.
2. Get your **Chat ID** — the simplest way is to message your new bot, then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser and read the `chat.id` field from the JSON response.
3. In `.env`:
   ```
   NOTIFIER=telegram
   TG_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:AAHfoo...
   TG_CHAT_ID=987654321
   ```

If `NOTIFIER` is left unset, netmon defaults to Telegram, so existing setups keep working with no changes.

### Discord

1. In your target Discord channel: **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**, then copy the webhook URL. No bot invite or permissions setup needed.
2. In `.env`:
   ```
   NOTIFIER=discord
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxx/yyyy
   ```

Discord delivery reuses the same report content as Telegram — the existing HTML formatting (`<b>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`) is automatically converted to Discord markdown, so reports render correctly in either service without any changes to the AI prompt.

> [!WARNING]
> Treat both the Telegram bot token and the Discord webhook URL as secrets — anyone with either can post messages through your bot/webhook. Don't commit them to version control (`.env` is already git-ignored).

---

## A Note on Measurement Mode

netmon runs `speedtest --secure --single --json` (see `runner.py`) — the `--single` flag means the test uses **one TCP connection**. This is deliberate: a single stream approximates what one real application on your network would actually get, since it is subject to the same window-size and packet-loss limits any ordinary download faces.

Multi-threaded speed tests (including Ookla's official CLI, and the speedtest.net web UI) open many parallel connections instead. That measures something different — the practical ceiling of your line — and will report noticeably higher numbers on fast connections. Neither figure is "wrong"; they answer different questions.

Two consequences worth knowing:

* **Don't compare netmon's numbers directly against speedtest.net in a browser.** The browser test is multi-threaded and will read higher. That gap is methodology, not a fault in your line.
* **On very fast links (roughly 500 Mbps+), expect single-stream figures to sit well below your subscribed speed.** Beyond the methodology gap, `speedtest-cli` is pure Python, so at gigabit speeds its own CPU overhead starts contributing too.

Since netmon exists to track *trends*, consistency matters more than peak numbers: keep one measurement method for the lifetime of your database. Swapping the backend mid-history puts a step change in your 24-hour graph that the AI commentary will faithfully report as a real speed jump.

## Connectivity Heartbeat

Full speed test cycles can be 30+ minutes apart, so a short outage could start and fully resolve without ever being noticed. Between cycles, netmon runs a lightweight TCP connect (not ICMP — avoids needing root) to `HEARTBEAT_HOST:HEARTBEAT_PORT` every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, and alerts once after `HEARTBEAT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` failed checks in a row, then again on recovery.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `HEARTBEAT_HOST` | *Optional.* Host to check reachability against (default `1.1.1.1`) |
| `HEARTBEAT_PORT` | *Optional.* Port to connect to (1–65535, default `443`) |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | *Optional.* Seconds between heartbeat checks while waiting for the next full cycle (positive integer, default `60`) |
| `HEARTBEAT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` | *Optional.* Consecutive failed checks before alerting (positive integer, default `3`) |

---

## Monitored Devices

The heartbeat above answers "is the internet reachable at all?" This is different: a specific list of devices *you* name — a router, a switch, an access point, a NAS, anything with a TCP port you can probe — checked individually, on the same `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` cadence as the heartbeat. Each device is tracked and alerted on independently: once after `MONITORED_DEVICES_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` failed checks in a row, then again when it comes back.

Configure it as a comma-separated list of `host` or `host:port` entries. Port defaults to `80` (a typical router/AP admin UI) when omitted — override it per-entry for devices that only answer on something else (e.g. `192.168.1.1:443` for an HTTPS-only admin UI, or a port you know is open on a switch/NAS).

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MONITORED_DEVICES` | *Optional.* Comma-separated `host` or `host:port` entries to watch (default: none — feature is off) |
| `MONITORED_DEVICES_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` | *Optional.* Consecutive failed checks before alerting, per device (positive integer, default `2`) |

Example: `MONITORED_DEVICES=192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2:8080,nas.local:22`

<b>Latest Test Metrics</b>
<pre>
Download: 178.5 Mbps
Upload: 45.2 Mbps
Ping: 23.1 ms
Devices Online: 9
</pre>

<b>24-Hour Dynamics Analysis</b>
Over the last 24 hours, the download speed averaged <code>140 Mbps</code>, but we saw a massive drop to <code>20 Mbps</code> at 8:00 PM right as device count jumped from <code>4</code> to <code>11 devices</code>. Clearly, someone's hogging the bandwidth or the ISP's mice were busy chewing on the fiber line again. Latency remained stable except for a brief spike during peak hours.

<b>Data Transfer (Latest Test)</b>
<pre>
Downloaded: 160.0 MB
Uploaded: 70.0 MB
</pre>

<b>Conclusion</b>
Expect periodic speed drops whenever local freeloaders stream 4K movies or the ISP potato infrastructure struggles.
